# Java 9 Lib
####This Group of classes are libraries for Java 9.0 made by LiamCoal  

## Libraries
The most important class is the Main.class file. Even though the jar file is
mostly for library purposes, it can be run in the terminal and still succeeds.
This is meant for running "addon" programs that are jarred correctly. Java9Lib.zip
is the original file that I got from this project. In other words, these libraries
do not require and other libraries.
